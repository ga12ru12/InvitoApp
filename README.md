THIS IS A PLACE TO STORE ALL THE BASE PROJECTS FOR REACT NATIVE APP. THE SOURCE CODES ITSELF IS NOT AN EXECUTABLE APP. EACH PROJECT SHOULD BE CREATED INDEPENDENTLY AND STORE IN SEPARATE FOLDERS

* FOLDER STRUCTURE:

For each project base, we should create a separate folder to store the entire mobile application project's codes into that folder. 
For example, the Account tab can be found in the UserAccount folder. The side bar menu can be found in the SideBarMenu folder.

* CODING STRATEGY:

We will keep update this project along the line as we go. But all codes pushed to this project need to be cleaned, clear following Enouvo coding standards and other 
good practice coding standards

* SETUP NOTE:

For each project base, we might need to include a setup_note.txt file in the project. Please note down any important information that might need for other developers to 
use and set up the project from scratch
